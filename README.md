In this project, I wanted to see how the social media network for the K-pop community in the Greater Seattle Area looked, and use R to analyze it. I run a fanbase for the fans of the K-pop group TWICE called seattleonces. I manually collected usernames from the following and follower lists of seattleonces as a starting point, and slowly added data from other local fanbases, small businesses, and K-pop stores to build a more expansive network. After this, I used various libraries found within R to clean up the data, create graphs, and perform analysis measures like degree and betweenness centrality, as well as Louvain clustering to identify possible communities.
